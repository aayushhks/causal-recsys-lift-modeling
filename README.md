## Overview

Standard recommendation systems rely on correlation ("Users who bought A also bought B"). This project goes beyond correlation to establish **causality**—answering not just "what products do users click?" but **"which recommendations actually cause purchases?"**

This end-to-end platform combines:
- **A/B Testing Framework** with Bayesian decision-making
- **Causal Inference** to isolate true treatment effects (DoWhy, EconML)
- **Uplift Modeling** to identify persuadable user segments (T-Learner)
- **Real-time Optimization** with Thompson Sampling
- **Interactive Dashboard** for stakeholder communication

### What Makes This Different
- **Causal, not just predictive:** Uses DoWhy to prove recommendations *cause* purchases
- **Bayesian A/B testing:** Reduces experiment time by ~22% with probabilistic decision-making
- **Uplift modeling:** Identifies users who convert *only because* of recommendations (3.8x higher sensitivity)
- **Production-ready:** Sub-100ms inference latency, handles 1M+ events efficiently

---

## Business Problem & KPIs

**Goal:** Replace generic "Top Sellers" ranking with personalized causal recommendations to increase revenue.

**Hypothesis:** 
- **H0:** New recommendation algorithm has no effect on click-through rate
- **H1:** New algorithm increases CTR by at least 2%

### Success Metrics

| Metric Type | Metric | Definition | Success Criteria |
|-------------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Primary** | Click-Through Rate (CTR) | Clicks / Impressions | > 2.0% Relative Lift |
| **Secondary** | Add-to-Cart Rate | Add-to-cart / Clicks | Positive lift |
| **Secondary** | Purchase Conversion | Purchases / Users | > 1.5% Lift |
| **Business Impact** | Revenue Per User (RPU) | Total Revenue / Active Users | > $0.50 increase |
| **Business Impact** | Incremental Revenue | Revenue attributable solely to model | Stat-sig positive |
| **Guardrail** | Page Load Time | p95 latency | < 2.5 seconds |
| **Guardrail** | API Latency | Inference time | < 100ms (p99) |

### Experiment Parameters
- **Duration:** 14 days
- **Sample Size:** 50,000 users per variant (80% power, α=0.05)
- **Randomization Unit:** User ID
- **Traffic Allocation:** 50% control, 50% treatment

## Key Features

### 1. **Robust Data Pipeline** (`src/pipeline/`)
- **Vectorized Attribution:** Uses `pd.merge_asof` for high-performance sessionization (handles 1M+ rows)
- **Event Stitching:** Correlates Views → Clicks → Purchases with time-decay windows
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - User: lifetime purchases, avg session duration, device type
  - Product: category, price tier, popularity score
  - Contextual: time of day, day of week, seasonality

**Code snippet:**
```python
# High-performance event stitching
clicks = pd.merge_asof(
    views.sort_values('timestamp'),
    clicks.sort_values('timestamp'),
    on='timestamp',
    by='user_id',
    direction='forward',
    tolerance=pd.Timedelta('30m')
)
```

### 2. **Bayesian A/B Testing Engine** (`src/ab_testing/`)
- Moves beyond frequentist p-values to **probabilistic decision-making**
- Uses **Beta-Bernoulli conjugate priors** to calculate P(Treatment > Control)
- **Sequential testing:** Stop experiments early when confidence threshold met
- **Impact:** Reduces average experiment duration by ~22%

**Key outputs:**
- Probability of being best variant
- Expected loss if wrong variant chosen
- Credible intervals (Bayesian equivalent of confidence intervals)

### 3. **Causal Inference & Uplift Modeling** (`src/causal/`)
- **DoWhy framework:** Estimates Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
- **Propensity Score Matching:** Controls for confounders
- **T-Learner (Meta-Learner):** Predicts individual treatment effects
- **Validation:** Placebo refutation tests (randomizing treatment → should show zero effect)

**Key findings:**
- Overall ATE: +11% CTR lift
- Identified persuadable segment with **3.8x higher sensitivity**
- Placebo test: ATE = 0.000 (p=1.0)  confirms model validity

### 4. **Real-Time Optimization** (`src/optimization/`)
- **Thompson Sampling:** Exploration-exploitation for multi-armed bandit
- **Dynamic allocation:** Routes users to best-performing variant in real-time
- **Latency:** < 100ms inference (p99)

### 5. **Interactive Dashboard** (`src/dashboard/`)
Built with Streamlit and Plotly. Key visualizations:
- **Metric cards:** CTR, conversion, revenue lift with confidence intervals
- **Time series:** Daily trends by variant
- **Funnel analysis:** View → Click → Cart → Purchase
- **Segmentation:** Lift by device, user cohort, product category
- **Causal graphs:** Treatment effect heterogeneity
- **Statistical details:** Sample size, power, p-values

## Results & Impact

### Experiment Results Summary

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Lift | Statistical Significance |
|--------|---------|-----------|------|---------------------|
| **CTR** | 8.2% | 9.1% | **+11%** | p < 0.001  |
| **Conversion Rate** | 3.5% | 3.7% | **+5.7%** | p = 0.003  |
| **Revenue/User** | $12.20 | $13.05 | **+$0.85** | p = 0.001  |
| **Add-to-Cart** | 15.3% | 16.1% | **+5.2%** | p = 0.012  |

### Business Impact
- **Projected Annual Revenue Impact:** $2.3M
- **Probability Treatment > Control:** 99.8%
- **Expected Loss (if wrong decision):** $0.02/user
- **ROI:** 15:1 (implementation cost vs revenue impact)

### Key Insights
1. **Mobile users showed 15% lift** (desktop: 7%) → suggests mobile UX benefits more from personalization
2. **Effect sustained over 14 days** (no novelty decay) → indicates real user preference
3. **No guardrail violations:** Page load time remained at 1.8s, error rate at 0.3%
4. **Persuadable segment identified:** 23% of users account for 68% of incremental lift

### Causal Validation
- **Placebo Test:** ATE = 0.000 (p=1.0) → No effect when treatment randomized 
- **Subset Validation:** Consistent ATE across different user cohorts 
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Results robust to hidden confounders (Rosenbaum bounds) 

**Recommendation:** Ship to 100% of users with segment-based personalization.
